TODO for Scheduler:
- Solve the fact that constraints which check multiple days can be invalidated (through the day breeding/combination)
- Check whether the lesson distribution is being fixed
- ONLY CHECKING THE FIRST CONSTRAINT (NOTE SURE)?
- Reformatting the prompt getting to be multishot, clearer and include examples


- Class overlap banning doesn't seem to be working, check (Not sure if this is still the case TEST)
- Swap to Claude 3.7 Sonnet OR gemini 2.5 pro experimental model as way better in programming 
- Figure out why sometimes I get an "unexpected end of input" from evalling the code given by the LLM
- Check wording of constraint and priority prompts to LLM (MAY HELP WITH ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)
- ROUGHLY Tune the variables & code
	- ** Classroom (and Lesson, though less important as fixing mixes them up) Mutations maybe?**
		- Maybe not necessary as most of the time day swaps can optimise (Not really though as they can only swap the lessons between themselves at the same days)
- Instead of just returning the best timetable, return the top 3 or 5 or something similar.



- Oh dear god, maybe implement different days per timetable? (FIRST DO UI, this is a MAYBE)
- Add titles to timetables such that constraints can check timeTable title (e.g. to enable: "The year 7s cannot have triple maths as they would get bored to death")
