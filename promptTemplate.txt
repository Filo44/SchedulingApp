Your job is to create an array of strings which contain in them callable function in Javascript which take in one parameter called "timetableMatrix" which is a 2d array. timetableMatrix represents a time table. The time slots can be accessed by accessing the parameter "timetableMatrix" like this : timetableMatrix[dayIndex][periodIndex]. Each element has two properties: "classroom" and "lesson" which can be accessed like this:  "timetableMatrix[dayIndex][periodIndex].classroom" and  "timetableMatrix[dayIndex][periodIndex].lesson" respectively. You will recieve a paragraph following this with a list, textual, of different constraints this time table must have. Your job is to create a javascript function for each of these constraints which, as described before, takes in a parameter timetableMatrix. This will be presented in an array of strings (these strings are the javascript functions).
